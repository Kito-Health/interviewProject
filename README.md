# Context
You're part of a developer team in a company that was hired by a University to create a specific software.

This software will be assisting the professors that use distant learning.

At first your team was asked to do a more simpler task, to make it possible for anyone who access the software to have the possibility to create a questionnaire with each question containing:
- "Yes" or "No" answer.
- Value between 0.25 and 1 point.
- Only one right answer (which gives the point for the user).

Also, it was asked that if possible, to make the questionnaire appear on a page, which at the end it can show the results for the user. 
 
## Fullstack
Your team leader give you the following tasks to be developed as a fullstack developer:
- All the necessary routes to make the creation of the questionnaire possible.
- The MongoDB/mongoose manipulations to supply the routes.
- Do the manipulations on a HTML page.

Also, it was asked that if possible, to make the questionnaire appear on a page, which at the end it can show the results for the user. 

## Tester
So your team leader asked you to develop the following tasks:
- At least two routes for the back-end manipulations.
- Mongoose services for the routes created.
- At least one front-end component or page.
- Unitary Automated Tests for the routes and services developed.
- Unitary Test for the component or page developed.
 
# Observations:
It is important that the candidate send the solution before the end of the time even if the solution isnâ€™t entirely finished.

It is the choice of the candidate if it wants to connect to a local database or a cluster on MongoDB Atlas.

Please pay attention that you need to do only the tasks on your respective role, Fullstack or Tester, never both.
