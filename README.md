# Context
You're part of a developer team in a company that we're hired by an University to create an specific software.

This software will be assisting the professors that use distant learning.

At first you we're asked to do a more simpler task, to make it possible for anyone who access the software to have the possibility to create a test/exam with a max of 15 questions, each one with a value between 0.25 and 1 (but always having a maximum of 10 per test/exam), and with up to four answers each.

So your team leader give you the tasks to develop:
- All the necessary routes for the API.
- The MongoDB/mongoose manipulations.
- Tests for each route developed on the back-end
- Front-end pages
